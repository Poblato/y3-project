# pick user position randomly

# generate N randomly positioned cochannel interferers

# calculate distance from each interferer to BS

# calculate received power of interferers and user

# calculate ASE


#####

# generate N users
# - pick user behaviours
# - pick user locations

# calculate distance from each interferer to BS
# calculate received power of interferers and user

# calculate BER for each user

# repeat

# calculate BER mean, variance

# repeat for other configurations (user distributions, behaviours)
